 *
 * When you start a Vehicle, the Vehicle will use the given scheduler to try to
 * be admitted in one of the tunnels. The scheduler.admit() will successfully
 * return when a tunnel is found, or it will wait and retry until it eventually
 * admits that vehicle in a tunnel.
 * 
 * The Vehicle does not know about the available tunnels and relies on the
 * scheduler to be entered in a tunnel.
 *
 * You may need to edit run() or doWhileInTunnel() for the
 * PreemptivePriorityScheduler and allow a vehicle to be signaled by an
 * Ambulance while running in a tunnel.
